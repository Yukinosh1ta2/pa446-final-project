# PA 446 Final Project – Digital Divide in Illinois

This project analyzes broadband access across Illinois counties using ACS 5-year data from the Census API.

It explores:
- How broadband access varies by county
- How broadband access relates to median household income
- How counties can be grouped into clusters based on income and broadband access

The project uses R, tidycensus, Quarto, and GitHub for a fully reproducible workflow.
